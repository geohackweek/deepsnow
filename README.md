# deepstack
keras implementation for spatio-temporal data. 

```
The Project will house a Keras implementation of CNN, as well as, various 
geostatistical and spatial methods.

# Objectives:
```
1. Gain knowledge in manipulating and managing multi-dimensional
   spatio-temporal datasets via python package.
2. Learn about the pipeline necessary to develop a
   deep learning product. 
3. 
3. Learn how to extract variable importance from a model
```
# Scientific Questions:
```
1. What are the spatio-temporal patterns of accumulation and melt?
2. What is the relationship of different topographic variable to the 
   accumulation and melt patterns?
3. What is the relationsihp of different climatic variables to the 
   accumulation and melt in patterns?
```
